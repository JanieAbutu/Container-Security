## Docker Security Best Practices

This project demonstrates the implementation of Docker security best practices to harden containerized environments and reduce the attack surface.

## Best Practices Implemented
1. **Use a Lightweight Base Image**
   - Replace a heavy base image with a lightweight one (e.g., alpine) to reduce vulnerabilities and shrink the        attack surface.

2. **Update Base Image & Run as Non-Root User**
   - Regularly update the base image and configure the container to run as a non-root user, limiting permissions      and reducing privilege escalation risks.

3. **Use Multi-Stage Builds in CI/CD**
   - Optimize Docker images with multi-stage builds in the CI/CD pipeline to reduce final image size, minimize        dependencies and improve efficiency and security.

4. **Restrict CPU & Memory for Containers**
   - Apply resource quotas to limit CPU and memory usage, preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring container       isolation.

## Outcomes:
 - Reduced attack surface
 - Enhanced runtime security
 - Smaller, more efficient Docker images
 - Improved container stability and reliability


## Skills Demonstrated
- **Docker & Containerization** – building and managing images/containers 
- **Container Security** – implementing non-root user configs and secure base images
- **CI/CD Optimization** – using multi-stage builds to streamline pipelines
- **System Resource Management** – applying CPU and memory quotas
- **DevSecOps Practices** – embedding security into development workflows
