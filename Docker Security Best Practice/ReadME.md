Docker Security Best Practices

This project demonstrates the implementation of Docker security best practices to harden containerized environments and reduce the attack surface.

Best Practices Implemented
1. Use a Lightweight Base Image
Objective: Replace a heavy base image with a lightweight one (e.g., alpine) to reduce vulnerabilities and shrink the attack surface.

2. Update Base Image & Run as Non-Root User
Objective: Regularly update the base image and configure the container to run as a non-root user, limiting permissions and reducing privilege escalation risks.

3. Use Multi-Stage Builds in CI/CD
Objective: Optimize Docker images with multi-stage builds in the CI/CD pipeline.
            Reduces final image size
            Minimizes dependencies
            Improves efficiency and security

4. Restrict CPU & Memory for Containers
Objective: Apply resource quotas to limit CPU and memory usage, preventing resource exhaustion and ensuring container isolation.

Outcomes:
Reduced attack surface
Enhanced runtime security
Smaller, more efficient Docker images
Improved container stability and reliability
